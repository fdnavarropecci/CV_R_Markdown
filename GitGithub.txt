# Git/Github basics
- clone: Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github into a folder on your local machine
- add: Track your files and changes in Git
- commit: Save your files in Git
- push: Upload Git commits to a remote repo, like Github
- pull: Download changes from remote repo to your local machine


- You can add two messages to your commit. First one is the header, second one is the message box
- git commit -m "This is the header" -m "This is the message box"

1) git pull
2) Do your changes
3) git add
4) git commit -m 
5) git push

SSH Keys
- ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "fdnavarropecci@gmail.com"     -- To connect your local machine to your Github account
- Name the key
- Add a Passphrase if you want
- Generates a private and a public key
- Copy your public key
-Go to Github, settings, ssh and gpg keys, new ssh key, copy that key, add key.
- Add your ssh key to the ssh agent


GIT push
- git push origin master


Creating a new repository with Git init
- git init   -- In the folder you're in

-git remote add origin "ssh link to your repo"

Git Branching

- git branch  : Shows branches 
- git checkout -b feature   -- Creating a new branch
- git checkout master   -- Switch to master branch
- git diff feature             -- Compares two versions of the code
- git merge feature            -- 

Another option to merge that branch would be:
- git checkout feature
- git add 
- git commit
- git push -u origin feature-readme-instructions

Do a pull request: Once you have pushed the changes it is easier to do it with the Github interface
- Create the PR add message
- Merge
- Switch to the master branch locally
- git pull
- git branch -d feature -- Delete the branch when you're done with it
